//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.


interface Car {
    manufacturer: string;

    [key: string]: any; // Allow any other optional properties
}

    let car: Car = { manufacturer, model };

    // Process optional keyword arguments
    for (let i = 0; i < options.length; i += 2) {
        const key = options[i];
        const value = options[i + 1];
